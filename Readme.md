## Sidekick

Just scratching my own itch. Heavily work in progress utility framework
for iOS. There's a lot to add, some to remove and much to polish.

#### Requirements 

The minimum iOS version is set to 5.1 in the podspec and ARC ought to be enabled.

#### Installation

Currently, Sidekick isn't mature enough for official Cocoapods repository. So install it
by adding the following line to project's podfile.

```ruby
pod 'Sidekick', :git => 'https://github.com/mkauppila/Sidekick.git'
```
